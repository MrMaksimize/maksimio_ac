# Biography
I bridge the gap between those who want to make an impact on society and the technology and data that enables them to do so.

Governments and nonprofits need help liberating data from silos and making it actionable. I help them develop data and technology strategies, and I write code to implement them.

I geek out about government and geospatial data, cybersecurity, data engineering and development processes. I love solving problems within transportation, emergency management, sustainability and housing.

For 5 years, I served as Chief Data Officer at the City of San Diego. Iâ€™m good at writing Python and running high-level strategy meetings. I built an advanced technical team that can navigate politics. 

Before that, I worked at Code for America and Puerto Rico, connecting businesses and government. I come from software engineering in the private sector.

I came to the US from Ukraine when I was 10 years old. I lived in 5 countries and speak 3 languages.
