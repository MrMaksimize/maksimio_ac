# Biography
Data is the wiring that connects our society, but we are missing opportunities. I help people use data to improve things like ambulance routing and city planning.

For the past 4 years, I served as Chief Data Officer at the City of San Diego. Iâ€™m good at writing Python and running high-level strategy meetings. I built an advanced technical team that can navigate politics. We help people get and leverage data for impact.

Previously, I worked at Code for America and Puerto Rico, connecting businesses and government. Before that, I ran large engineering teams in the private sector.

I came to the US from Ukraine when I was 10 years old. I lived in 5 countries and speak 3 languages.
